# Maintenance

Current Node version 16.1.0

Run `nvm use` to use current node version in terminal.
You should have `nvm` installed locally.

We are using `Yarn` package manager. To install package dependencies run `yarn install` after setting current node version, so all dependencies are built for correct node version.
