As a result, it can be difficult to know exactly which document is the best option for safeguarding your photography business against disagreement and lawsuits. Below we’ve broken down the most popular types of contract templates to help you pick the best legal document for your business and determine when and how to use it.",
				"tips": {
					"tip1": {
						"body": "A <strong>commercial photography contract</strong>, while similar to other types of contracts in form, is unique in function, as it speaks to the unique relationship a photographer has with a commercial business and includes specific legal forms like an image licensing agreement. These contracts are best suited for brand, product, food, and architecture photoshoots."
					},
					"tip2": {
						"body": "<strong>Portrait photography contracts</strong> and forms are designed to lay out the terms and conditions of the photoshoot and protect photography professionals against potential liability arising out of copyright disputes, image usage, and payment issues. These are ideal for family portraits, model shots, and virtually all other types of portrait sessions."
					},
					"tip3": {
						"body": "<strong>Model release contracts</strong> specifically focus on your right as a business owner to use the model’s likeness in any way you choose. Providing you with coverage to add the images to your portfolio, add them into your marketing materials, and otherwise share them, these contracts are necessary anytime you photograph people."
					},
					"tip4": {
						"body": "An <strong>event photography contract</strong> template is made to simplify the agreement between you and your client, when you’re hired to shoot a large celebration. As with a model release contract, event photography contracts often include photography release forms to help you get legal permission to use the images for your own purposes. They can be used for any type of event, such as an anniversary celebration, a puppy birthday, and a graduation party to name a few."
					},
					"tip5": {
						"body": "<strong>Wedding contracts for photographers</strong>, like other templates, include the standard terms and conditions sections needed to get a legally binding agreement in place.

				"subtitle": "From generic contract templates to NDAs, there are a lot of agreement forms out there for freelancers and consultants to choose from. This can make it difficult to know what you need to protect your business and your clients. Below we’ve included a shortlist of must-have contract templates for freelancers and consultants to help you know when and how to use each of these contracts.",
				"tips": {
					"tip1": {
						"body": "<strong>General Contract Templates</strong>, like freelance copywriting and freelance graphic design contract templates, allow you to form a standard agreement with a client for a specific project or set period of time. With these contracts, you can define everything from the scope and timeline of the project to the cost. And since any number of clauses and provisions can be added, general contract templates can be used by nearly any freelancer in any industry. "
					},
					"tip2": {
						"body": "<strong>Non-Disclosure Agreements</strong> (NDA) <strong>Templates</strong> are designed to keep proprietary information from being shared in an unauthorized manner. With non-disclosure agreements in place, both you and your clients can freely share business information with one another, as the contract guarantees that no sensitive information can be used or shared. Whether you’re working with established brands or disruptive startups, having an NDA in place is always a smart idea. "
					},
					"tip3": {
						"body": "<strong>Retainer Contract Templates</strong>, unlike standard contract templates, are written to form a long-term relationship between you and your clients. With retainers, you can work on an ongoing basis for a particular business – writing content, designing graphics, and offering other valuable expertise – to help them build their brand. And since retainer contracts are built on a monthly budget or set number of deliverables instead of a single project, you don’t have to draft up a new contract every time you start a new deliverable."
					},
					"tip4": {
						"body": "<strong>White-Label Contract Templates</strong> are unique. Rather than forming an agreement between you and your client directly, they essentially put you in the position of a subcontractor, where you create content for your client’s clients. Since they are more complicated, though, this means they can also be more confusing to create. Fortunately, with the right legal counsel, you can draft a white-label template to reuse as needed."

			},
			"type": {
				"question": "What type of businesses should take this business personality test?",
				"answer": "The business personality test by HoneyBook is an assessment created specifically for small business owners, creative entrepreneurs, sole proprietors and freelancers. Our resources cater to businesses in the 1-15 employee range.  Some of the most popular businesses that take the test are web designers, DJ’s, photographers, graphic designers, brand specialists, marketing and PR consultants, copywriters, makers, artisans, videographers, educators and coaches, health and wellness professionals, accounting and finance small businesses, interior designers, social media consultants, and more service-based professionals."

				"question": "How much does this assessment cost? ",
				"answer": "It’s completely free. Have at it."
			},
			"why": {
				"question": "Why was this small business personality test created?",
				"answer": "During 2019, the HoneyBook team has been talking to creative entrepreneurs and small business owners, listening to their varied pain points and fielding the big questions: How do I find my ideal client? What can I do to grow my business, when I feel like I’m already doing everything? The instagram algorithm did what? How do I get my clients to pay on time without having to badger them? At HoneyBook, we’re not psychologists, but we do talk to thousands of small business owners every month — face to face, in our office, at monthly meetups, via email, over video chat. This business personality test was created to learn about each small business’ unique style and growth hurdles, and then provide the resources, technology, and conversation that will help you catapult over them in 2020."

				"question": "How is this different than Myers Briggs types?",
				"answer": "If you’re comparing your results to your Myers Briggs personality type, here’s what to look for: The Actualizers among us are likely to be a Myers Briggs ENTP, INTP, ENTJ, or INTJ. The Creatives are likely to be a Myers Briggs: ESFP, ISFP, ESTP, ISTP. The Connectors in the group are likely to be a Myers Briggs: ESFJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, ISTJ. And the Visionary folks are likely to be a Myers Briggs: ENFP, INFP, ENFJ, INFJ. All these letters seem like gibberish? Let Elon Musk and Oprah clear it up for you."
			},
			"basedOn": {
				"question": "What are the business personality types based on?",
				"answer": "The four main business personality types are our interpretation of the four quadrants within Myers Briggs types, while the four stages of business are based on HoneyBook’s member base and knowledge of solopreneurs and small business owners. All in all these four personalities and four business different small business stages give us 16 possible results. The Actualizer business personality can be described as a ‘doer’ and executer, the Visionary business personality type is someone who has great perspective and big-picture thinking, the Connector business personality type is someone who relates is strong at building relationships between people and between people and resources, and the Creative business personality type indicates someone with truly unique and non-routine ways of seeing and interpreting the world around them. Wondering what type you are? Don’t wait to find out — take the test."
			},
			"disagree": {
				"question": "I don’t agree with my business personality test results, what can I do?",
				"answer": "First, feel free to take the test again. Secondly, we realize each person’s business is unique and every personality is multi-layered. You may feel like you’re more “Creative Rising Star,” when your results say “Actualizer Rising Star.” Second, consider the contents of your business personality results page: Are the tips still actionable? Are the resources still relevant to your small business? If so, we recommend diving into the resources and executing on a few of the recommendations — you might be surprised about how well they match your business. Finally, feel free to reply to your results email with feedback for how we can improve the test and results. "

		"features": {
			"question": "What features does HoneyBook offer?",
			"answer": "<p>HoneyBook offers easy-to-use features that help small business owners run their business more efficiently and seamlessly manage clients from first inquiry to final payment.

		},
		"howInstantDeposit": {
			"question": "How does Instant Deposit work",
			"answer": "With Instant Deposit, you can transfer and access funds in minutes (if not seconds), rather than the usual 2-3 business days. Plus, Instant Deposits are available all day, every day, which means no more long waits for money over the weekends. Any credit card payment up to $5,000 made via HoneyBook is elegible for instant deposit. Transfers have a low 1% transfer fee ($5 minimum). You can learn more about Instant Deposits <1>here</1>."
		},
		"whatsProposal": {
			"question": "What is a Proposal?",
			"answer": "On HoneyBook, a Proposal is an all-in-one booking file that helps you get booked faster. How, you ask? By combining invoice, contract, and payment into one file, a Proposal allows your client to review your services, provide an electronic signature, and make their first payment in one fell swoop. The 1-2-3 experience cuts out the unnecessary steps and wait times, which means you can win clients faster and with less effort."
		},
		"whyProposal": {
			"question": "Why should I use a Proposal for my business?",
			"answer": "Put simply, a Proposal is a more efficient tool for converting clients quickly.  As a small business owner, it’s unlikely you have the time to craft a document, send it, make sure it gets signed (or paid), then repeat the process over and over again. A Proposal puts invoice and contract together (at last), so you can just send and kick off each client relationship quickly. If you currently send a contract and invoice to clients, you could (and should) be sending a Proposal. Learn more about <1>sending a Proposal</1>."
		},
		"proposalTemplates": {
			"question": "Will my HoneyBook account come with Proposal templates?",
			"answer": "Yes! Your HoneyBook account will come pre-loaded with templates for a variety of files, including Proposal templates. You can, of course, edit the template so that it reflects your brand, includes a contract if you have one, and presents your services perfectly. Whenever you want to send a Proposal, you’ll be able to start from a Proposal template, or recently sent Proposal, which means you’ll be able to create and send a new  Proposal in minutes if not seconds. Learn more about <1>Proposal templates</1>."
		},
		"proposalVsOthers": {
			"question": "How are Proposals different from Invoices or Contracts?",
			"answer": "Proposals combine invoices and contracts into one file that you can send to clients. If you need to send a stand-alone invoice or contract, however, you still can! You’d simply use our <1>Invoice</1> or <3>Contract</3> feature, rather than a Proposal."
		},
		"testProposals": {
			"question": "Can I test out a Proposal before I send it to a client?",
			"answer": "Of course. Be sure to start a 7-day free trial to try out all HoneyBook features and see how a Proposal would work for your business. And, if you decide to subscribe, you’ll always be able to preview your Proposal (or any other file) from the client’s perspective before you send it."
		},
		"otherFeatures": {
			"question": "What other features does HoneyBook offer?",
			"answer": "As much more than a proposal software, HoneyBook offers a robust suite of tools to help small business owners track and qualify leads, sell their services, onboard and communicate with clients, and get paid for their work. HoneyBook features include invoicing, contracts, proposals, questionnaires, bookkeeping, automation, scheduling and more. Head to our <1>Features page</1> for more details."
		},
		"requiredPayment": {
			"question": "What does it take to start using HoneyBook payments?",
			"answer": "Next to nothing! Because we act as your payment processor, you can simply sign up for a HoneyBook account and start collecting client payments — no switching, connecting, or upstart required. With one account, you can consolidate all aspects of your business. Interested? Learn more about <1>HoneyBook features</1>."
		},
		"processingFees": {
			"question": "What are your processing fees?",
			"answer": "At the moment, payments received through HoneyBook incur a 3% processing fee for credit cards OR 1.5% fee for ACH/bank transfers. These fees are not in addition to what you would pay when using other systems, and are comparable to those you would see in Paypal, Square, and other payment processors. Learn more about <1> HoneyBook’s payment processing and fees</1>."
		},
		"clientPayments": {
			"question": "Do you automatically move client payments to my bank account? ",
			"answer": "Yes — we directly deposit funds into your account! That means as a small business owner whose time is valuable, you don’t have to manually hit a ‘Payout’ button over and over again. Plus, HoneyBook’s Bookkeeping tool allows you to easily track all paid, upcoming and outstanding payments and even zoom in to see payments’ estimated deposit date. Learn more about <1>HoneyBook’s Bookkeeping tool</1>."
		},
		"paymentProcessor": {
			"question": "Can I use my own payment processor?",
			"answer": "In an effort to keep all your business information in one place, HoneyBook acts as the payment processor for any credit card or ACH (bank transfer) payments you receive. At the moment, we're not able to process payments through HoneyBook using personal accounts with PayPal, Stripe, Venmo, etc.If you do need to accept any payments made outside of HoneyBook (via cash, check, or another method), you can easily mark those payments as paid within HoneyBook."
		},
		"passTransactionFee": {
			"question": "Can I pass the transaction fee onto my client?",
			"answer": "Currently there is not a built-in way to pass the processing fees along to your clients. We recommend researching your state's laws on the matter, or speaking with a financial professional—in many states, it is illegal to pass processing fees on to a client. If you live in a state where it is legal, it's possible to add these charges as line items in your Invoices or Proposals. However, again, we'd recommend <1>researching your state's requirements</1> on messaging this to your clients, as the requirements may vary."
		},
		"paymentDispute": {
			"question": "What if my client disputes a payment they made?",
			"answer": "Client disputes can be scary, but here’s the good news — we work with <1>you</1> to understand the situation, instead of automatically refunding your client. Our disputes team will contact you to get relevant details from you in order to resolve the situation in the best way possible."
		},
		"clientPaymentExperience": {
			"question": "What does my client experience when they pay an invoice?",
			"answer": "When you send an invoice or proposal to a client, they will receive a personalized email from you including a secure link to the invoice. They can then click the link and easily access the invoice from their mobile phone or laptop (no login or password required). Your client will then view your invoice exactly as you’ve created it in HoneyBook, and smoothly transition into the payment screen, which includes your brand logo, name and number of payments, as well as the option for them to opt into automatic payments (if you’ve turned the feature on). Learn more about your <1>client’s experience</1>."
		},
		"fraudProtection": {
			"question": "Does HoneyBook offer fraud protection?",
			"answer": "Yes, we are proud to offer in-house fraud monitoring. Our in-house fraud team and automated systems monitor all payments to help prevent unauthorized or risky payments. When your clients pay using HoneyBook you can have piece of mind knowing their payments are safe and secure."
		},
		"inPersonPayment": {
			"question": "Can I accept payments in person?",
			"answer": "Yes, if you are meeting in person with a client, HoneyBook’s ‘book in person’ feature allows you to securely allow them to pay, or for you to enter in their information on the spot. We currently can't accept credit card swipes or scans."
		},
		"integrateQuickbooks": {
			"question": "Can I integrate my QuickBooks account?",
			"answer": "Absolutely. Connecting your HoneyBook account with QuickBooks Online enables the systems to automatically sync your payments from HoneyBook directly into your QuickBooks account. Here’s how it works: When a client submits a payment to you in HoneyBook, the integration will automatically create an invoice and payment in QuickBooks for you. Once the payment deposits into your bank account, you can match this payment in your banking section in QuickBooks. We also account for transaction fees for you; after you've matched a payment, you can view all transaction fees from the Expenses section in QuickBooks."
		},
		"help": {
			"question": "How can HoneyBook help me as a doula?",
			"answer": "HoneyBook is a platform that combines the functionality of multiple programs like invoices, schedules, and client communication so that you can handle everything you need in one service. Our automation allows you to carry over the best part of your process between clients. But we know doulas require a personal relationship with each of their clients. We have your brand at the front and center of client communications so that clients know they are talking with you. Finally, in a business that rarely has a “normal” schedule, HoneyBook’s mobile app lets you stay in touch wherever you go."
		},
		"others": {
			"question": "How do other doulas use HoneyBook?",
			"answer": "Doulas typically use HoneyBook to manage in-bound inquiries through our contact form which you can embed in your site. We streamline client communication by allowing you to read and respond to emails as well as automate follow-ups and tasks in one place. Then you can complete your client process using our online invoices and contracts to ultimately get booked and paid. But that’s just the beginning, you can shine above other doulas by taking advantage of our automated workflows so that concerned parents get responses and well-prepared information packets as fast as possible."
		},
		"intakeForm": {
			"question": "Does HoneyBook provide a client intake form?",
			"answer": "Yes — your HoneyBook account will come pre-loaded with templates, including a client intake form for doulas. On HoneyBook, we simply refer to it as a contact form. You’ll be able to quickly and easily customize the color, layout and imagery in order to make it work as a client intake form for your doula business. You can gather information such as: names, dates, email addresses, client needs & background and more in order to make sure they’re a fit for your doula services. You’ll be able to embed your client intake form directly on your website, which allows for clients’ information to be sent directly from the form into your HoneyBook project pipeline (no copy and pasting information). In addition to embedding your doula client intake form, you can send clients a direct link to the form so they can easily access and fill out the relevant information any time. You can learn more about how our contact forms can work for your doula business <1>here</1>."
		},
		"questionnaire": {
			"question": "Does HoneyBook provide a questionnaire for doulas?",
			"answer": "Yes — your HoneyBook account will come pre-loaded with various doula forms, including a doula questionnaire. Because your doula services are unique to you, you’ll be able to customize your doula questionnaire to appropriately gather the information you deem relevant. Your best bet is to start by creating a questionnaire template to work off of, and then tweaking it as necessary for each client. Your doula questionnaire can then be sent along to your client. Your client will receive an email from you, along with any message you want to add, that takes them to the client questionnaire within their client portal. From there, they’ll be able to complete the questionnaire. You’ll be notified when the client has submitted their questionnaire in order to take next steps. Again, all of this information and communication is clearly captured within HoneyBook for reference at any time. You can learn more about how to create doula questionnaires <1>here</1>."

		},
		"photoContractNeed": {
			"question": "Why do I need a photography contract?",
			"answer": "<p>There are quite a few reasons why you should use photography contracts when you shoot weddings, engagements, newborns, and various events. But it all boils down to protection.</p><p>With a contract in place, you can guard your business against potential lawsuits, disagreements with clients, and payment disputes. And you can give your clients peace of mind that you’ll provide all the services and deliverables you say you will. (Hint: this can make a big difference if you request a large deposit upfront.)</p><p>So, even if you’ve made it this far without using contracts, adopting one ASAP is arguably the best decision you can make for your business now and in the future.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractHowTo": {
			"question": "How do I write a photography contract?",
			"answer": "<p>Writing a photography contract, just like other types of contract writing, takes a lot of legal know-how. However, you can make it easier if you have a photography contract template. With one, you can reuse standard legal verbiage for liability indemnification, model release, and image ownership. And you can easily plug in your own legalese (preferably written by a lawyer) to fill in the gaps.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractWhy": {
			"question": "Why should I not write my own photography project contract?",
			"answer": "<p>While it may not seem like an issue to create a simple portrait or wedding photography contract PDF on your own, it can land you in hot water down the road if you aren’t careful. Not only is it possible to forget crucial aspects of your contracts, but without proper legal support, you can unintentionally create loopholes for your clients to jump through.</p><p>Ideally, the best option is to combine one of HoneyBook’s templates with an hour or two with a lawyer to make sure you have all the protection you need to keep your business (and your clients) happy.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractStart": {
			"question": "How do I start a photography business?",
			"answer": "<p>When launching a photography business -- whether it be studio or location-based -- it’s important to get your business forms and documents figured out early on. Without them, you can end up scrambling when you finally land a contract with a photography client.</p><p>Using photography contract templates, like those in HoneyBook’s collection, allows you to get your contracts written up quickly and with minimal effort. All you have to do is plug your important legalese into the form and customize the design to match your style preferences and save it to your HoneyBook template library.</p><p>Then, you can autofill your clients’ information into the smart fields, quickly edit the session details to fit your agreement, and send it off for signatures.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractFee": {
			"question": "What is the sitting fee for photographers?",
			"answer": "<p>Put simply, a sitting fee is an expense that photographers charge to take pictures during a scheduled session. It can either be lumped into the total cost of the contract or separated out from the purchase price of edited prints, but in either case, the sitting fee enables the photographer to cover the cost of their work, in the event that the client ultimately chooses not to purchase any prints.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractPaid": {
			"question": "Do photographers get paid before or after?",
			"answer": "<p>While some photographers only request payment after the final selection of images have been edited and delivered to the client, there are many who require a deposit prior to arriving on location. And arguably, this is the safer option. Not only does it guarantee payment (if only partial), in the event your clients dispute their responsibility or find themselves unable to pay the final bill, but it also makes the total cost of a session much more palatable to clients who might otherwise balk at the price tag.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractHave": {
			"question": "Do photographers have contracts?",
			"answer": "<p>Yes. Regardless of the type of session, photographers should always have a contract in place before shooting any photos. Not only does it protect your studio from potential lawsuits, but it also ensures that the clients’ side of the bargain is upheld.</p><p>With a written agreement, you can lay out everything from pricing and copyright to deliverables to make sure you and your client are on the same page. This ultimately minimizes confusion or conflict during the engagement too.</p>"
		},
		"photoContractNecessary": {
			"question": "Do I need a photography contract?",
			"answer": "<p>Are photography contracts important enough to warrant having one? The short answer is yes. Not only can they save you valuable time and sanity when working with difficult clients, but they also create a layer of protection around your business if a client decides to file a lawsuit.</p>"
		},
		"consultantContractIncluded": {
			"question": "What should be included in a freelance contract?",
			"answer": "<p>Regardless of your industry, there are quite a few provisions that should be included in every freelance contract, including:</p><ul><li>Deliverable ownership</li><li>Liability limitation and indemnification</li><li>Pricing and payment deadlines</li><li>Project scope</li><li>Revisions (how many and what does each entail)</li><li>Cancellation or termination (including your “kill fee” requirement)</li><li>Confidentiality</li><li>Point of contact (client-side)</li><li>Clarification of your role as an independent contractor, rather than an employee</li></ul>"
		},
		"consultantContractWriting": {
			"question": "How do I write a freelance contract?",
			"answer": "While contracts should always be approved by legal counsel to ensure they’ll provide adequate legal protection, contract templates make it fast and easy to get a client agreement written up. Using a template, you can reuse standard clauses for liability indemnification, proprietary information, and project ownership. And you can easily plug in scope and pricing provisions to get your contract ready for a lawyer to review and polish."
		},
		"consultantContractOwn": {
			"question": "Why should I not write my own consultant agreement?",
			"answer": "<p>It may seem simple enough to write up a contract for consulting services, but handling it on your own can land you in hot water if you aren’t careful. Not only can you forget to include important details, but you can unintentionally create loopholes for your clients to jump through.</p><p>However, if you are set on creating your own consulting contract, the best option is to use one of HoneyBook’s templates and meet with a lawyer for an hour or so to make sure all of your clauses and provisions are airtight.</p>"
		},
		"consultantContractStartingOut": {
			"question": "How do I start a consulting services business?",
			"answer": "<p>When you start consulting – either as a side hustle or as a full-time contractor – it’s important to get your business forms figured out.</p><p>Using HoneyBook’s consulting contract templates, you can get your contracts drafted quickly and with minimal effort. All you have to do is edit existing clauses, plug your additional project details into the document, and customize the design to match your style preferences. Then, you can share it with your clients and collect e-signatures to get the project underway.</p><p>You can even save customized templates to your personal HoneyBook library to make contract creation and signing easier the next time around.</p>"
		},
		"consultantContractFee": {
			"question": "What should a freelancer charge?",
			"answer": "<p>The truth is: there is no standard rate out there. In each industry, niche, and vertical there’s a wide range of prices. When deciding what to charge for your own services, you should consider the following:</p><ul><li>Whether you plan to charge on a flat rate, hourly rate, per word (for freelance writers and editors), by service packages, or something else altogether</li><li>Your experience in the industry</li><li>The results you generate (do your successes justify you charging more for your work)</li><li>The size and scope of the project being requested</li><li>The deadline of the project (if the timeline is tight, you’ll want to consider a rush fee)</li><li>The number of revisions offered with the project</li><li>Ownership rights to the deliverables</li><li>Additional requirements like travel or specific software needed to complete the project</li></ul>"
		},
		"consultantContractPaymentTime": {
			"question": "Does an independent consultant get paid before or after?",
			"answer": "There are likely some consultants who choose only to bill clients after the project has been completed. But more often than not, independent consultants will charge deposits and request compensation after each project stage. And arguably, this is the safest option, as it both increases the likelihood of being paid for the work completed and makes the total cost of the project more manageable for clients."
		},
		"consultantContractNecessary": {
			"question": "Do I need a freelance contract?",
			"answer": "Yes. Not only does a contract make projects easier to manage, but they also create a layer of protection around your business should a client decide to dispute or ignore any of the provisions listed in it."

		},
		"schedulingExternalCalendar": {
			"question": "How do I sync my external calendar to HoneyBook scheduling?",
			"answer": "When you set your availability for sessions, your clients will only see those time blocks, but what if you add something to your Google calendar that overlaps with your availability? When you sync your HoneyBook calendar to Gcal, it will automatically block off your Google calendar events so you never get double booked. Reference this <1>Help Article</1> to sync your calendars."

		"webDesignerOthers": {
			"question": "How do other web designers use HoneyBook?",
			"answer": "<p>Web designers use HoneyBook to manage clients from first touch to final payment. This usually starts by using our contact form to collect in-bound leads from your website. After a lead comes in, web designers typically respond with either a brochure outlining their service offerings, previous work examples, pricing, or a project questionnaire to gather more information about the client’s needs. To respond to leads quickly, web designers can create simple automated tasks that get clients a personalized and branded response within minutes. When a client is ready to move forward with a project, we typically see web designers send a proposal (recommended, since it includes a contract and in an invoice) or just an invoice. Web designers also use HoneyBook’s payment scheduling feature to bill for a retainer or any payments that need to follow. Throughout the entire process, HoneyBook sends notifications for important client actions like when they’ve selected a service, signed a contract, replied to a message, or made a payment. That way, you’re always in the loop with what’s going on in your web design business and know exactly what needs to happen next.</p><p>Once the design process starts, web designers use HoneyBook to manage all communication with their clients. And if it’s a multiple-vendor project, HoneyBook allows you to connect with multiple people in one place so everyone stays on the same page. Having vendor communication on the same platform with the clients allows visibility and alignment between everyone involved so it’s easier to execute memorable and effective websites.</p>"

			"question": "How do other event rental businesses use HoneyBook?",
			"answer": "<p>Event vendors and services typically use HoneyBook to manage clients from first touch to final payment. This process usually starts by customizing and embedding our contact form on your website, so that new inquiries funnel right into HoneyBook. After an inquiry comes in, event rental companies usually respond with what we call a “brochure”, which is a flexible document you can use for many scenarios, including showcasing past events, testimonials, or listing out your services and pricing. Or, if you want to gather more info about the potential client first, you can send a questionnaire. Using pre-built HoneyBook templates for event rental companies, this can all happen in a matter of minutes. Even better, event vendors often set up an automated workflow to trigger a response to each new inquiry. event rental companies who usually have a consultation or call with clients typically use our scheduling tool, which allows clients to select a time to meet with you based on your pre-determined availability. Once that’s worked out, event rental businesses usually move on to sending a proposal (invoice and contract combined) or an invoice. Before billing your clients, you’ll be able to define how you want to bill them — either a one-time payment, recurring payments, or a custom payment schedule. Again, we’ll provide invoice templates to make your billing simple to set up.</p><p>Throughout the entire client lifecycle, you’ll receive real-time notifications from HoneyBook for major events like when a client responds to a brochure, signs a contract or makes a payment — we’ll even show you read receipts for any messages. That way, you always know where every client and project stands.</p>"
		},
		"eventRentalsTemplates": {
			"question": "Does HoneyBook provide invoice templates for event rental companies?",
			"answer": "<p>Yes — your HoneyBook account will come pre-loaded with various templates for event rental businesses, including an invoice template. You’ll be able to quickly customize the template to fit your projects and clients. If you offer packages, you’ll be able to create those and quickly pop them into your invoice. On the other hand, if you’d like to add single line items, that’s easy too.</p><p>As an event rental company, we know getting paid for your work is critical and not always as easy as it should be. With HoneyBook’s billing software for event professionals, you’ll be able to bill clients on a recurring basis, as a one-time charge, or create a custom payment schedule of your choosing. You’ll be able to split payments by percentage or require a percentage or cost (like a deposit) up front. And don’t worry, when it comes to billing for your services, we’ll always do the math for you.</p><p>Lastly, automatic payment reminders help you gently remind clients of upcoming and overdue payments, without having to be the bad guy or chase them down. As always, you’ll be able to customize the content of the reminders if you’d like.</p>"

Once that’s worked out, photo booth rental businesses usually move on to sending a proposal (invoice and contract combined) or an invoice. Before billing your clients, you’ll be able to define how you want to bill them — either a one-time payment, recurring payments, or a custom payment schedule. Again, we’ll provide invoice templates to make your billing simple to set up.</p><p>Throughout the entire client lifecycle, you’ll receive real-time notifications from HoneyBook for major events like when a client responds to a brochure, signs a contract or makes a payment — we’ll even show you read receipts for any messages. That way, you always know where every client and project stands.</p>"

			"question": "Does HoneyBook provide invoice templates for photo booth rental companies?",
			"answer": "<p>Yes — your HoneyBook account will come pre-loaded with various templates for photo booth rental and event-based businesses, including an invoice template. You’ll be able to quickly customize the template to fit your projects and clients. If you offer packages, you’ll be able to create those and quickly pop them into your invoice. On the other hand, if you’d like to add single line items, that’s easy too.</p><p>As a photo booth rental company, we know getting paid for your work is critical and not always as easy as it should be. With HoneyBook’s billing software for event professionals, you’ll be able to bill clients on a recurring basis, as a one-time charge, or create a custom payment schedule of your choosing. You’ll be able to split payments by percentage, or require a percentage or cost (like a deposit) up front. And don’t worry, when it comes to billing for your services, we’ll always do the math for you.</p><p>Lastly, automatic payment reminders help you gently remind clients of upcoming and overdue payments, without having to be the bad guy or chase them down. As always, you’ll be able to customize the content of the reminders if you’d like.</p>"

First, when a new client reaches out via your website, you’ll be able to funnel that inquiry into HoneyBook by using the contact form feature — an embeddable form you can totally customize to fit your site. Or, if new clients reach out via email, you’ll be able to use our chrome extension to quickly send that potential client’s information and initial email right into HoneyBook in a few clicks.</p> <p>After that new lead inquires about your services, personal trainers usually respond with what we call a “brochure”, which is a flexible document you can use for many scenarios, including showcasing your philosophy, testimonials, or listing out your services and pricing. This will allow your user to learn about your different services and choose the best one for them, whether it’s a personal session, a group training, an online workout or whatever you offer. If you want to gather more info about the potential client before sending the brochure, we recommend sending a questionnaire. Using pre-built HoneyBook templates for personal trainers, this can all happen in a matter of minutes. Even better, personal trainers often set up an automated workflow to trigger a response to each new inquiry.</p> <p>If at any time you want your client to be able to schedule a call or meeting with you, you can use the scheduling tool to make it happen. This tool will allow clients to select a time to meet with you based on your pre-determined availability. You’ll be able to create different types of sessions to fit how you work. For example, let’s say you offer 15 minute kick-off calls on Mondays and Wednesdays only, 60 minute training sessions every day, 30 minute weekly check-ins on Tuesdays and Thursday, and you only ever want to have these occur between 7am and 1pm — you’d be able to easily configure all of that within our scheduling tool.</p> <p>After deciding if the client is a good fit, personal trainers usually move on to sending a proposal (invoice and contract combined) or an invoice. Before billing your clients, you’ll be able to define how you want to bill them -- either a one-time payment, recurring payments, or a custom payment schedule. Again, we’ll provide personal training invoice templates to make your billing simple to set up.</p> <p>Throughout the entire client relationship, you’ll receive real-time notifications from HoneyBook for critical actions like when a client signs a contract or makes a payment — you’ll even get read receipts for any messages.

			"answer": "<p>Landscapers typically use HoneyBook to manage clients from initial inquiry to final payment. This usually starts by embedding the HoneyBook contact form on your website (you’ll of course be able to customize it completely). After a new lead fills out the form, landscapers usually follow up by either sending a brochure outlining their landscaping and lawn care services and pricing, or sending a questionnaire in order to ask some additional questions to learn more about the project. </p><p>After deciding if the client is a good fit based on the information they’ve already provided via the Contact Form or questionnaire, we typically see landscapers move on to sending a Proposal or an Invoice — the main difference being that a Proposal includes an invoice plus a contract for your landscaping services all in one.</p><p>For billing clients, landscapers typically create a custom payment schedule, which allows you to define when payments are due and for what amounts. Alternatively, landscapers who offer a recurring service, like monthly maintenance for example, usually set up recurring payments, which bill clients on an ongoing basis.</p><p>Once the client has committed to working with you, landscapers use our scheduling tool to coordinate consultations and any other meetings needed to keep the project on track.</p>"

Outsourcing the work to a program like HoneyBook will save you hours each week and provide your clients a seamless, consistent, and beautiful experience.</0>\n\t\t\t<1>With HoneyBook, your invoice templates and recently used invoices are saved in the system, so that you never have to start from scratch and can craft new invoices in less than a minute. On your clients end, they’re able to open your invoice from an email, review it, and pay — either from their smartphone or computer.</1>\n\t\t\t<2>In addition, online invoices on HoneyBook come with critical built-in features like automatic payment reminders, which let clients know when they have an upcoming payment and/or remind them when a payment is overdue. That means you’re more likely to get paid regularly and on time, without having the burden of keeping track of and chasing down overdue payments.</2>\n\t\t\t"
